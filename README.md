# Details
This program stores your personal DBD stats: escape rate as Solo survivor or SWF, your killrate as killer. It also shows average stats of other players in your games and average Bloodpoints you and other players gain.
It can also be used to notify when a lobby is found or when the match is about to start by playing a sound and/or bringing DBD window to front, so you can do other activities while waiting for lobby.

# Note:
Only 1080p (1080×920) and 720p (1280×720) DBD resolutions in fullscreen are supported now
