# DBD-Monitor
Initial commit

DBD Monitor stores your personal DBD stats and notifies when a lobby if found.
This program stores your personal DBD stats: escape rate as Solo survivor or SWF, your killrate as killer. It also shows average stats of other players in your games.
It can also be used to notify when a lobby is found by playing a sound and/or bringing DBD window to front, so you can do other activities while searching for lobby.
